## Configuring

### 1. Java
You must configure the java version.

- Click the edit button.
- Click the settings tab.
- Check the java installation box, click auto detect, and select the version that begins with 17.
- Click ok to save your selection

### 2. Memory
You must configure the memory to ensure enough is available for Forge.

Below is a recommended memory amount chart.
| System Memory | Recommended RAM(GB)  | Recommended RAM(MB) | Performance Level |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| 2GB or less   | Unplayable           |                     | Cannot Launch     |
| 4GB           | 2GB                  | 2048MB              | Low but playable  |
| 6GB           | 4GB                  | 4096MB              | Good              |
| 8GB           | 6GB                  | 6144MB              | Great             |
| 10GB or more  | 8GB                  | 8192MB              | Perfect           |

Please note that any more than 10GB of ram may actually make your game run worse due to the Java Garbage Collector.

Start on the same settings tab as java.
Check the memory box(If it isn't checked yet)
Set the minimum memory to 512MB

Set the maximum memory by MB according to the chart above(Make sure the MB part is removed, ex. 4096MB would be 4096 in prism)

### 3. Mods
The base pack does not include any extra mods added after it's creation. So you have to add the additional mods.

The mods are in the #mod-additions channel.

This can also help if you want to install additional clientside mods.

#### Opening the mods tab
- Click on the instance once to select it.
- Open the instance configuration.

![Click the edit button.](https://i.ibb.co/56yVC9T/ModEdit.png)

- Open the mods tab located in the instance configuration. (Make sure your Minecraft is closed)

#### Adding mods
You can add mods either by dragging the jar file into the mod tab. Or, clicking add file and selecting the jar.

You can also click Download Mods to look up and download mods from Curseforge or Modrinth.

#### Removing mods
Select the mod you want to remove from the mod list and click remove.
If you just want to temporarily disable the mods, you can untick them.


# You are done!
You can now just hit launch to start the game.
